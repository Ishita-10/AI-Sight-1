# AI-Sight

## About

AI Sight uses Google's TensorFlow lite under the hood to 
power the object detection model (mobilenetv1 by TensorFlow). Additionally, We are using Google Maps navigation 
intent to provide navigation support while running the model as a foreground service and 
delivering alerts about objects in front of the user. This combination of custom alerts 
along with state of art navigation support from Google Maps create an holistic experience 
for the blind user
